# PPID-Spoofing-Injected

Building upon my previous repo of PPID Spoofing, extended to now inject the process we spawn.

Currently implementing classic injection with a calc payload. This means AV gets angry and that the Notepad will crash at the injection. 

I plan to update to modern injection later.
